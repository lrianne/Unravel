        Fasten off, but leave a long enough tail to sc around. (Probably a few feet at least).

        Jellyfish streamers/tentacles
        \n\n
        I found the streamers were easiest and most fun when done freeform. All of them are a little different, but I used the same basics for each one to maintain consistency. You can check out my curly cue sampler to get an idea of what each type of curl will look like. Also, you can change up the hook size for a different look. I used a G hook for the blue jellyfish and an H hook for the purple jellyfish. On each jellyfish, there are 8 tentacles of varying width and length.
        Chain either 30, 40, 50, 60 or even 70.
        \n
        Work 2 (or 3) sc in each chain stitch OR work 2 (or 3) hdc in each chain stitch. If you’re starting with sc, then work into 2nd chain from hook. If you’re starting with hdc, then work into 3rd chain from hook.
        \n
        Now, think of this as a Choose Your Own Crochet Adventure. Continue working sc or hdc, working 2 or 3 stitches into each chain across, then fasten off, leaving a tail.
        \n
        I found it best if you stick with a particular pattern long enough to establish the right curl, then change it to create a different type curl. Don’t change your stitch type too quickly. You can curl the curly cues properly or leave it messy, up to you!

        Assembly
        \n\n
        Step 1: Attach the safety eyes between rows 12 and 13 on the cap, about 8 stitches apart.
        \n\n
        Step 2:  Use the embroidery thread to sew on a mouth halfway between the eyes.
        \n\n
        Step 3: Attach the tentacles to the bottom panel by weaving both tails of the tentacles through stitch spaces in the panel, and tie a double knot to secure. You can weave the ends in, or maybe not, since it’ll be hidden inside the stuffed head. I chose to weave in ends because I don’t know how hard the kids will pull on the tentacles.
        \n\n
        Step 4: Match up the seam stitch of the panel against the seam stitch of the cap. Insert your hook through both loops (front to back) on one stitch on the cap, and pull through a loop of the panel’s tail. Work a chain stitch. Then insert your hook through the same cap stitch, and through the first stitch on the panel, pull up a loop and complete a sc. (It’s ok if you fudge this. You just need to attach the two pieces together to get started.)
        \n\n
        Step 5: For the next stitch and for each stitch around, insert hook from outside of cap through all 4 loops (cap and panel). Work a sc.
        \n\n
        Step 6: Once you’ve gone almost around, stuff the head with fiberfill, then continue working sc around to close up the head. Join to the first sc with a sl st. Fasten off and weave in ends.
